# rust-webxr

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/servo/webxr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/servo/webxr)

A safe Rust API that provides a way to interact with Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality devices and integration with vendor-specific APIs like OpenVR, Oculus, GoogleVR and Magic Leap. The API is inspired by the WebXR Device API (https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) but adapted to Rust design patterns.

It's used in the WebXR implementation for Servo browser, but can be used outside of Servo.

Some notes on our plans for this Api: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Rust-webxr-plans--Ad8iXHKI15DKsFhfT3ufGiQiAg-xmqpUtCzy8yNMGWwUUxsz
